   This repository contains the implementations and write-ups for the three major assignments I completed as part of the Vision course at Institut Teknologi Bandung.

   ## Assignments Overview

   1. **Image Preprocessing (Assignment 1)**  
      The first assignment focused on image preprocessing techniques, including edge detection and Hough Transform. We used methods like convolution with filters and explored parameter tuning for line detection using the Hough Transform.

      - **Key Topics:**
      - Convolution with filters (Prewitt, Scharr, Sobel)
      - Edge Detection using custom filters
      - Hough Transform for line detection
      - Parameter tuning for improved line detection

      - **Report:** [Assignment 1 Report](./Assignment-1/Assignment-1.pdf)  
      - **Code:** [Assignment 1 Code](./Assignment-1)

   2. **Feature Matching and Image Stitching (Assignment 2)**  
      In the second assignment, we explored feature matching techniques and used homography to stitch images together. Key concepts include feature descriptors, matching algorithms, and RANSAC for robust estimation of homography matrices.

      - **Key Topics:**
      - BRIEF Descriptor for feature matching
      - Homography computation and RANSAC
      - Image stitching using homography

      - **Report:** [Assignment 2 Report](./Assignment-2/Made_Arbi_Parameswara_23522002.pdf)  
      - **Code:** [Assignment 2 Code](./Assignment-2)

   3. **Object Detection on Video (Assignment 3)**  
      The final assignment involved detecting objects in a video after converting the video into frames. We explored methods for tracking and detecting objects across frames, evaluating multiple algorithms and comparing their performance.

      - **Key Topics:**
      - Lucas-Kanade Algorithm for tracking
      - Forward Additive and Inverse Compositional Algorithms
      - Evaluation of tracking performance under various conditions (translation, scaling, contrast changes)

      - **Report:** [Assignment 3 Report](./Assignment-3/Assignment-3.pdf)  
      - **Code:** [Assignment 3 Code](./Assignment-3)

   ## Results Summary

   - **Assignment 1:** Achieved efficient edge detection and line fitting using custom filters and Hough Transform.
   - **Assignment 2:** Successfully stitched images with minimal distortion using BRIEF descriptors and homography.
   - **Assignment 3:** Evaluated object tracking algorithms under various scenarios, identifying strengths and weaknesses for each method.
